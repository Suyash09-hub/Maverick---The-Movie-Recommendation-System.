ABSTRACT
A movie recommendation is important in our social life due to its strength in providing enhanced entertainment. Our Project “Maverick: The Movie Recommendation System” can suggest a set of movies to users based on their interest, or the popularities of the movies.
Although, a set of movie recommendation systems have been proposed, most of these either cannot recommend a movie to the existing users efficiently or to a new user by any means. In this paper we propose a movie recommendation system that has the ability to recommend movies to a new user as well as the others. 
It mines movie databases to collect all the important information, such as, popularity and attractiveness, required for recommendation. It generates movie swarms not only convenient for movie producer to plan a new movie but also useful for movie recommendation. Experimental studies on the real data reveal the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system.

ABOUT THE PROJECT

Create
: A Movie Recommendation System with the Help of Machine Learning & Python. 

Idea
: The basic Idea for this project is to Use a Movie Dataset, Sort it in a manner that it provides the best possible 5 movie recommendations for the input movie. 

Goal
 : The goal of the system is to provide personalized recommendations that help users find high quality videos relevant to their interests. In order to keep users entertained and engaged, it is imperative that these recommendations are updated regularly and reflect a user's recent activity on the site.

Requirement
: Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the user's choices. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.
